![Photo of me](_resources/photo.jpg)

That's me, I am 22 years old and recently graduated from Tec de Monterrey (Monterrey, Mexico). I like football, pop music, reading short stories and watching movies (thrillers are the best!). In the last couple of years I have been working and doing research in the fields of virtual assistants, computer vision and software development. More recently I am working on my iOS development skills to build smart apps targeted at health care. I am also interested in data science as a new programming paradigm where data and models, not rules, determine the behavior of a program (programming 2.0).

Throughout my childhood I developed a passion for science and math. I found that are no boundaries to human curiosity and started to view technology as a means of self expression. I decided to study Engineering Physics to master mathematical modeling and understand the fundamental principles of modern technology (how fool I was thinking I would _master_ something by just attending college lectures). However, I did learn about the fundamentals and took a few lessons for future projects:
- Math (and most things in life) is no piece of cake, so learn the basics well (practice, never talent alone, makes perfect)
- Research and development take a lot of time and serious work, so you better love what you are doing (the process, not the outcome should be the reward)
- Technology is a miracle born from a mix of human intelect and intent, remember to be intentional about everything you do (have a compass that tells you wether you are heading in the right direction)

Now that I am older and wiser, I want to communicate the most important steps I take towards achieving my goals and express myself along the way. This has been the hardest skill to master for a long time, but not anymore!
